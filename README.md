# **In order to build a high-quality knowledge base, it's important that we ensure each unique question exists on Quora only once. Writers shouldn't have to write the same answer to multiple versions of the same question, and readers should be able to find a single canonical page with the question they're looking for. For example, we'd consider questions like “What are the best ways to travel in india?”, “How can a person travel around in india?”, and “What are effective transportation available in india?” to be duplicate questions because they all have the same intent. To prevent duplicate questions from existing on Quora, we've developed machine learning and natural language processing systems to automatically identify when questions with the same intent have been asked multiple times.** 

Problem Statement __
